# MA4K9 Hyperelliptic Project Code

This code was written for my research project entitled "Counting points on elliptic and hyperelliptic curves over finite fields". The project centred on an investigation of Kedlaya's algorithm for counting such points.

The code in this repository automates a large part of one of the algorithm's key processes (namely, computing the matrix of the action of Frobenius on the basis of the first Monsky-Washnitzer cohomology group). It involves applying an extended transform to a polynomial which can then be analysed to produce the desired matrix.
